# Homepage

This is the repository hosting the files for my [personal website](https://samilkaraduman.github.io).  

It is based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and uses the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme. 

## Getting started

In order to contribute, or fork this for yourself, you will first need to clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamilKaraduman/my-hugo-site.git
```

Secondly, make sure you have Hugo installed. Installation will depend on your platform, so make sure to view their [documentation](https://gohugo.io/installation/).

Once everyting is set up, run the following commands to start a Hugo development server:

```bash
cd my-hugo-site
hugo server
```

You will then have a web server running at http://localhost:1313.
