# I'm Samil!


Passionate about technology, programming, lifestyle, fitness, cycling, and self-improvement. Currently, Iâ€™m learning Python and refining my skills with Neovim. I recently switched my GitHub Pages site to a Hugo theme and am excited about the possibilities it offers.

My goal is to share valuable content and contribute to the open-source community by publishing my projects on GitHub for the world.  

When I am not coding, you can find me cycling, working on my fitness, or exploring ways to improve my lifestyle. I am constantly looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow.
